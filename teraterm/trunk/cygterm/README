// P R E F A C E //

    This is an experiment trying to substitute a terminal emulator for the
    DOS window as Cygwin console.  However, assume that it is carried out 
    without the mechanism of remote login.  In other words, it doesn't use
    `inetd', `in.telnetd' or `login'.

// I D E A //

    Invoking a terminal emulator and Cygwin shell, and relaying their I/O.
    One simple solution is just to implement a program to do this.

// S P E C I F I C A T I O N //

    1. When this program is run, a terminal emulator starts, and a shell
       prompt appears there, it can be used for Cygwin console.

    2. The terminal emulator and the shell have to be selectable.

    3. Screen control of the shell side has to work correctly and follow
       window resizing of the terminal emulator.

    Details of cygterm.exe

      [1] Prepare a listener socket to wait for a TELNET connection.
          Find out an unused TCP port number to assign to the socket from a
          specified range.

      [2] Invoke a terminal emulator in another thread.
          Then specify IP address `127.0.0.1' and the port number [1] in the
          command line arguments.

      [3] Accept the connection from the terminal emulator.
          Refuse it except a connection from `127.0.0.1' in security.

      [4] Do fork(), and in the child process, invoke a shell under PTY
          (pseudo terminal) slave side.

      [5] Relay I/O between the TELNET connection socket [3] and the PTY
          master side of [4].

    Support for TELNET protocol (options negotiation)

        Receive the notification of terminal-type from a terminal emulator,
        and apply it to the environment variable TERM on a shell.

        Receive the notification of terminal-size from a terminal emulator,
        and apply it to window size of PTY.

        [Ref. RFC854 TELNET PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION]

    cygterm.exe is implemented as an window-less Win32 application.

// I N S T A L L //

    Do `make install' under Cygwin.

    * Be sure to specify the install directory by BINDIR in Makefile
      in advance.  cygterm.exe and cygterm.cfg are installed in BINDIR.
      cygterm.cfg is not overwritten.

// C O N F I G U R A T I O N //

    cygterm.cfg is a configuration file.  This includes definitions for the
    command lines of a terminal emulator and a shell, and several parameters.
    cygterm.cfg is loaded from the same directory cygterm.exe exists in.

      An example of cygterm.cfg
      +-----------------------------------------------------------------------
      | TERM = C:\program files\ttermpro\ttermpro.exe %s %d /KR=SJIS /KT=SJIS
      | TERM_TYPE = vt100
      | PORT_START = 20000
      | PORT_RANGE = 40
      | SHELL = /bin/bash
      | ENV_1 = MAKE_MODE=unix
      | ENV_2 = HOME=/home
      |   :         : 

    TERM
    ----
        This is the command line to execute a terminal emulaitor.
        Specify the full path to the command if it isn't in Windows search path.
        This needs to be described `%s' and `%d' for the host and port number.

    TERM_TYPE
    ---------
        This terminal type is adopted when the terminal emulator did not give
        a terminal type. (default: vt100)  Then this value is set to the
        environment variable TERM on a shell.

    PORT_START
    ----------
        This is the minimum TCP port number allowed for use. (default: 20000)

    PORT_RANGE
    ----------
        This is the maximum number of TCP ports allowed for use. (default: 40)

        cygterm.exe looks for an unused port number between PORT_START and
        PORT_START+PORT_RANGE, and therefore can be run concurrently as many
        as this number.

    SHELL
    -----
        This is the command line to execute a shell in Cygwin side (normally
        /bin/bash).  Specify the full path to the shell.

    LOGIN_SHELL
    -----------

    HOME_CHDIR
    ----------

    ENV_X
    -----
        This is the environment variable to be set when starting the shell.
        It should be of the form `name=value' (like putenv).  It is possible to
        give as many environment variables as needed by beginning with "ENV_".

    Command Line Options

        cygterm.exe [-t 'terminal-emulator'] [-p port-number] [-dumb]
                    [-s 'shell'] [-v 'env-var' ...]

    -t 'terminal-emulator'
            Specify the command line of a terminal emulator to execute.
            This format is the same as TERM in the configuration file.
            The command line should be enclosed in quotes to include spaces.

    -p port-number
            Instead of executing a terminal emulator, try connection to this
            port number of localhost.  It is considered another program uses
            `-p' option to use Cygwin via cygterm.exe

    -dumb
            Suppress the TELNET options negotiation.  And ignore any TELNET
            commands sent from terminal side.  The environment variable
            TERM is set to `dumb' on the shell side.

    -s 'shell'
            Specify the command line of a shell on Cygwin to execute.
            This format is the same as SHELL in the configuration file.
            The command line should be enclosed in quotes to include spaces.
            Any command can be spedicied even if a non-shell command.

    -ls
            Execute a shell as a login shell.

    -nols
            Execute a shell as a normal (not login) shell.

    -cd
            The current directory is moved to the user home directory and
            the shell is invoked.

    -nocd
            The shell is invoked without changing the current directory.

    -v 'env-var'
            Specify the environment variable to be set when starting the shell.
            This format is the same as ENV_X in the configuration file.
            The expression should be enclosed in quotes to include spaces.
            One or more `-v' options are available.

    The terminal emulator or connection port number, and the shell on Cygwin,
    these need to be specified at least.  If these are given on the command
    line, cygterm.exe can be run without configuration file cygterm.cfg.

    cygterm.exe is an Win32 application which uses cygwin1.dll.  It can be run
    from Cygwin command line or a shortcut on Windows.

    * It is necessary the Windows environment variable PATH includes a
      directory path of cygwin1.dll (normally Cygwin-root\bin) to be run
      from Windows.

// N O T E S //

    * Attention in TeraTerm

        If your terminal emulator is TeraTerm be careful not to save [Setup]
        [Save setup] in the situation that it was started by cygterm.exe.
        Otherwise telnet port number of TCP/IP is saved but 23 you will be
        confused by connection failure when you normally run TeraTerm to do
        telnet.  In that case it will be recovered by saving the setting 
        with specifying TCP/IP Port# 23.

// T E S T E D  O N //

// C H A N G E S //
v1.06_07 2006/08/19 (by maya.negeta@gmail.com)
        * If setted Windows enviroment variable `HOME', cygterm use it.

v1.06_06 2006/08/18 (by sue@iwmt.org)
        * Limit a parameter length of both '-s' and '-t' option.

v1.06_05 2006/08/18 (by maya.negeta@gmail.com)
        * Create mutex object for running check by installer.

v1.06_04 2006/08/15 (by sue@iwmt.org)
        * Add 'LOGIN_SHELL' entry which the shell is invoked as the login shell in cygterm.cfg file.
          LOGIN_SHELL: yes | no

v1.06_03 2006/08/15 (by sue@iwmt.org)
        * Add 'HOME_CHDIR' entry which home directory is changed in cygterm.cfg file.
          HOME_CHDIR: yes | no

v1.06_02 2006/02/09 (by babydamons@yahoo.co.jp)
        * Generated CygTerm's ICON by "DotWork 2.50".
          "DotWork 2.50" is available at http://www5a.biglobe.ne.jp/~suuta/.
          Special Thanks to "suuta at hamal dot freemal dot ne dot jp"

        * Makefile was changed, "clean" target was changed to don't remove cygterm.ico.

v1.06_01 2006/02/08 (by babydamons@yahoo.co.jp)
        * The following configuration file reading was supported:
            + /etc/cygterm.conf
            + ~/.cygtermrc

        * Shell is invoked with user's home-directory.

        * Get account configuration from /etc/passwd by getpwnam(3),
          getting account name from USERNAME environment by getenv(3).

        * Makefile was changed, default build is with icon executable.

v1.06 2004/01/24
        * The following command line options were added:
            -t 'terminal-emulator' (specifies the terminal emulator)
            -p port-number (specifies the port# to connect)
            -dumb (specifies dumb terminal mode)
            -s 'shell' (specifies the shell)
            -v 'env-var' (specifies environment variables)

        * Fixed to fail in `make install' if BINDIR was not found.

        * cygterm.cc and README.txt were changed to English version.

v1.05 2003/01/14
        * Fixed to transmit Ctrl+SPACE (NUL).
          The NUL character was not able to be transmitted even if Ctrl+SPACE
          was typed, because it was ignored simply as an way to handle the
          newline CR+NUL.

v1.04 2002/12/08
        * Changed to display error messages for failure to execute a terminal
          emulator or a shell.

        * Makefile was changed.
          + do not overwrite cygterm.cfg when `make install'.
          + add the gcc option -fno-exceptions against the GCC-3 link error.

v1.03 2002/07/24
        * Fixed to convert terminal type into lower-case when cygterm received
          it from a terminal emulator.  Because some upper-case values such as
          `ANSI' `VT100' of the environment variable TERM might not be found
          in terminfo depending on the kind of terminal emulator.
          (Windows 2000 telnet.exe, etc)

v1.02 2002/07/22
        * Fix to be able to start a terminal emulator even if it was a console
          application.  (Windows 2000 telnet.exe, etc)
          There was a mistake in calling CreateProcess().

        * Fixed to suppress duplicate newline on a shell by canceling LF when
          a terminal emulator sent CR+LF.  (Windows 98 telnet.exe, etc)

        * Embedded the version number in cygterm.exe executable code.
          How to check: $ strings cygterm.exe | grep version

v1.01 2002/07/19
        * Fixed that cygterm did not work with zsh or tcsh. 
          Input was blocked when zsh or tcsh started, because the approach to
          open the pseudo terminal was not good.

v1.00 2000/12/17
        * The initial version was released.
