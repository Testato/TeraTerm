* SSH2 version TTSSH        [User's Manual]
==============================================================================

* Introduction
  "TTSSH" is an extension of the terminal emulator TeraTerm Pro that adds Secure Shell 
  version 2 (SSH2) protocol support to TeraTerm. This version of TTSSH replaces the
  original version created by Robert O'Callahan that supported only SSH1.

* Content of archive file
  Archive (zip) file contains:

  File name               Description  
  ---------------------+-----------------------------------
  readme.txt              this file
  ttxssh.dll              DLL
  msvcr71.dll             MFC7.1 runtime library
  TERATERM_sample.INI     sample ini file
  ---------------------+-----------------------------------

* Installation
  1. To add SSH2 support to TeraTerm you should already have installed the 
     original version of TeraTerm Pro with additional package supporting UTF-8.
     
     The original version of TeraTerm Pro can be downloaded from: 
         http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/ttermp23.zip
         
     Additional package for UTF-8 support can be downloaded from:
         http://sleep.mat-yan.jp/~yutaka/windows/index.html
  
  2. Backup all files from the TeraTerm directory.
  
  3. Extract ttxssh.dll and msvcr71.dll files from the archive into the TeraTerm directory.
  
  !! IMPORTANT !!
    SSH2 version of TTSSH is compatible only with UTF-8 version of TeraTerm Pro.
    

* How to use SSH
  Perform the following steps to establish network communication using SSH (Secure Shell):
  
  1. Select "New connection" from the TeraTerm menu and chose "SSH" option from "Service" (port 22).
  
  2. Enter username and password in "SSH Authentication" dialog and press OK button.
  
  3. If you successfully pass authentication, UNIX shell will appear on TeraTerm terminal. 

* SSH autologin
  Perform the following command line options to be able to autologin with SSH protocol.
  
  SYNOPSIS:
     ttermpro.exe HOSTNAME:22 /ssh [/1|/2] /auth=password /user=USERNAME /passwd=PASSPHRASE

  SYNOPSIS:
     ttermpro.exe HOSTNAME:22 /ssh [/1|/2] /auth=publickey /user=USERNAME /passwd=PASSPHRASE /keyfile=PRIVATEKEYFILE

  EXAMPLE: SSH1 password authentication auto-login (username nike  password kukuri)
     ttermpro.exe 192.168.1.3:22 /ssh /1 /auth=password /user=nike /passwd=kukuri

  EXAMPLE: SSH2 password authentication auto-login (username nike  password kukuri)
     ttermpro.exe 192.168.1.3:22 /ssh /2 /auth=password /user=nike /passwd=kukuri

  EXAMPLE: SSH2 public-key authentication auto-login (username kitakita  password oyaji 28  private-key-file d:\tmp\id_rsa)
     ttermpro.exe 192.168.1.3:22 /ssh /2 /auth=publickey /user=kitakita /passwd=oyaji@28 /keyfile=d:\tmp\id_rsa


  NOTICE: blank operation
    If you include the blank in the password or file path, replace the blank(' ') to '@'.
    And also if you use the atmark character in them, write two continuation '@@' instead of '@'.
