* UTF-8 support package for TeraTerm Pro        [User's Manual]
==============================================================================

* Introduction
  This software package adds UTF-8 & SSH2 support to terminal emulator "TeraTerm Pro".


* Installation
  If you use TeraTerm installer program, click installer program and install TeraTerm according to the instruction of the installer.
  If you use TeraTerm archives, extract TeraTerm zip file and copy all files to your directory.
  

* Unicode configuration
  To use UTF-8, select "Terminal" from the TeraTerm Pro "Setup" menu.
  Inside the dialog-box, select "UTF-8" from "Kanji(receive)" or "Kanji(transmit)".
  There is no need to restart TeraTerm Pro to activate these configuration changes.
  When "UTF8" is specified with '/KT' or '/KR' option in the command line,
  UTF-8 encoding/decoding can be used during transmitting and receiving of data.
  
  To enable character sets other than Japanese, you have to set properly the locale and 
  codepage parameters in the 'teraterm.ini' file. See example of these values below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Locale for Unicode
Locale = japanese

; CodePage for Unicode
CodePage = 932
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Check the following web-sites to learn more about setting of locale and codepage in TeraTerm:

  [Example of WindowsXP Simplified Chinese]
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ; Locale for Unicode 
    Locale = chs 
    
    ; CodePage for Unicode 
    CodePage = 936   
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  [NOTE] for Mac OS X users
    For Mac OS X(HFS+) use "UTF-8m" encoding. Currently it only supports receiving mode.
    To use this mode specify "UTF8m" as the value of the command line parameter '/KR'.

* ANSI color change & concatenating multi-line patch
  This package includes "ANSI color & concatenating multi-line patch".
  The following description was added to clarify its functionality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;	ANSI color definition (in case FullColor=on)
;	* UseTextColor should be off, otherwise background and foreground colors of
;	  VTColor will be assigned to color-numbers 0 and 7 respectively, even if
;	  they were specified in ANSIColor.
;	* ANSIColor is a set of 4 values that are color-numbers(0--15),
;	  red-value(0--255), green-value(0--255) and blue-value(0--255).
ANSIColor=0,0,0,0, 1,255,0,0, 2,0,255,0, 3,255,255,0, 4,128,128,255, 5,255,0,255, 6,0,255,255, 7,255,255,255, 8,0,0,0, 9,255,0,0, 10,0,255,0, 11,255,255,0, 12,128,128,255, 13,255,0,255, 14,0,255,255, 15,255,255,255

;	Enable continued-line copy
EnableContinuedLineCopy=on
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  [HINT]
    When TermType is set to "xterm" the applications (i.e. vim6) supporting ANSI color
    will appear in color.
    This function is from the original TeraTerm.


* Wheel mouse
  This package supports wheel mouse button.


* Mouse cursor
  Mouse cursor can have one of the 4 shapes listed below

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Mouse cursor type (arrow/ibeam/cross/hand)
MouseCursor = hand
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    arrow = standard arrow cursor
    ibeam = ibeam cursor(default)
    cross = cross cursor
    hand  = hand cursor


* Translucent window
  With this package installed TeraTerm can have translucent window (only in Windows 2000 
  and higher versions of Windows).
  Default value is 255 (opaque).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Translucent window (0 - 255)
AlphaBlend = 230
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Cygwin connection
  This package makes it possible to connect local Cygwin by using built in Cygterm.
  Select "Cygwin connection" from "File" menu or press "Alt + G " to connect to Cygwin.
  Prior connecting to Cygwin, Cygwin installation path has to be entered into TeraTerm 
  ini file.
  The format is "drive-letter:\directory".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Cygwin install path
CygwinDirectory = c:\cygwin
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  [NOTE]
    If cygterm fails to start you might need to download its source and
    recompile it.
    Cygterm source is available from the following web-site:
      http://www.dd.iij4u.or.jp/~nsym/cygwin/cygterm/index-e.html


* Select all buffer
  Select "Select all" from "Edit" menu to select complete screen buffer and copy it
  into clipboard.
  
  [HINT]
    Dragging the mouse while Alt key is pressed selects rectangular block of text.
    This function is from the original TeraTerm.


* Add comment to the log file
  Select "Comment to Log..." from "File" menu to add comment to the log file.
  Maximum allowed length of comment is 255 characters.


* Additional settings dialog
  Select "Additional settings" from "Edit" menu to configure the new TeraTerm options 
  introduced by the UTF-8 package.


* line buffer
  If you configure 10000 lines over of TeraTerm line buffer, you need to 
  setup MaxBuffSize entry in the 'teraterm.ini' file. See example of this value below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Max scroll buffer size
MaxBuffSize=500000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Availability of SSH
  SSH(Secure SHell) version 1 & 2 are supported when using the SSH2 compatible TTSSH version.

  These are the following options of SSH.
  
     option     explanation
     /1         connection with SSH1
     /2         connection with SSH2 (does not support SSH2 at server, do SSH1 connection)
  
  Example of command line option (IPv4 & SSH2 & UTF-8)

    ttermpro.exe /KR=utf8 /4 192.168.1.3:22 /ssh /2

  [NOTE]
      UTF-8 version of TeraTerm is not compatible with original TTSSH and
      with Japanese version of TTSSH. 
      It only works with the latest version of TTSSH supporting SSH2.


* macro reference: connect

There are 3 types of connection you can establish from TeraTerm macro: 

  - Telnet connection (port 23) 
  - SSH1 or SSH2 connection (port 22) 
  - Connection via COM port 
  
  Telnet connections 
  
  connect 'myserver:23 /nossh' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver:23' 
  
  Using /nossh is strongly recommended. Without this parameter TeraTerm will start connecting with the same method (telnet or SSH) that was used during last time when teraterm.ini file was saved. In case it was SSH than your macro will try to connect via SSH and will eventually fail. 
  
  SSH connections 
  
  connect 'myserver /ssh' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1 /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2 /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1 /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2 /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file' 
  
  The first way will start SSH connection without defining whether SSH1 or SSH2 has to be used. Parameters /1 and /2 force to use SSH1 or SSH2 method. The last 6 ways allow to skip popup dialog and pass username and password directly from macro. Please note that /auth=password or /auth=publickey is the parameter saying that authentication will be done by entering password or private-key-file thus you should not replace the word 'password' or the word 'RSA/DSA' in it with actual password. Only the words shown above with italic font has to be substituted with actual values. 
  Please remember that entering actual username and password in TeraTerm macro will cause them to be stored as an open text and it is your responsibility to keep such macro is secure location. 
  
  Connections via COM port 
  
  connect '/C=x' 
  
  Here x represents COM port number. For example to connect via COM port 1 the command will look like: connect '/C=1'

        waitregex <string1 with regular expression> <string2 with regular expression> ...
        
        Supports Oniguruma regular expressions: RE.txt

Pauses until the string(maximum 256 characters), which matches one or more character strings with regular expression is received from the host, or until the timeout occurs. Maximum number of the regular expression strings is 10.

If the system variable "timeout" is greater than zero, the timeout occurs when <timeout> seconds have passed. If the "timeout" is less than or equal to zero, the timeout never occurs.

The "waitregex" command returns one of the following values in the system variable "result":

Value   Meaning 
----------------------- 
0       Timeout. No string, which satisfies the condition, has been received. 
1       <string1 with regular expression> has received.
2       <string2 with regular expression> has received.
:       :
:       :
n       <stringn with regular expression> has received. n=1..10.

The received line is stored in the system variable "inputstr".
The first matched pattern is stored in the system variable "matchstr".
Group matched patterns of regular expressions are stored in 9 system variables from "groupmatchstr1" to "groupmatchstr9".

Example:
timeout = 30
waitregex 'Longhorn' '.*@sai' 'Pentium\d+' 'TeraTermX{3}'
int2str s result
messagebox s 'result'
messagebox inputstr 'inputstr'
messagebox matchstr 'matchstr'


* macro reference: mpause

Format:
        mpause <time>

Pauses for <time> milliseconds.

Example:
mpause 100              Pause for 100 milliseconds.



* macro reference: random

Format:
      random <intvar> <value>

Generates the random number from 0 to <value>.
The value is returned in the integer variable <intvar>.

Example:
random val 100            val=0..100



* background transparency
  TeraTerm supports window background transparency. Now TeraTerm has two types of transparency function. You can select either function. 
  
  (1) AlphaBlend window
  In this type TeraTerm window can be background transparency. You can setup the value of transparency. The range of transparency is from 0 to 255. The more transparency reduces the value, the more window transparency is blinding. You can configure the value in teraterm.ini file. The entry is 'AlphaBlend' of [teraterm] section. I show the example in the following:
  
	; Translucent window (0 - 255)
	AlphaBlend =255
     
  As a point that should be noted, this function is enabled on only Windows2000 later.
  
  (2) Eterm lookfeel window
  In this type TeraTerm window looks like Eterm background transparency. If this function is enabled, TeraTerm window becomes background transparency and mixes the wallpaper with your specified image file(*.jpg). And also this function is also enabled on Windows9x or NT4.0. You can configure this function in [BG] section of teraterm.ini file. If you switch it on or off, you should change 'BGEnable' value.

	[BG]
	; Use Background extension (On / Off)
	BGEnable = Off

  Other settings are the following entries.

	; Use AlphaBlend API (On / Off)
	BGUseAlphaBlendAPI = On

	; Susie plugin path
	BGSPIPath = plugin

	; Fast window sizing/moving
	BGFastSizeMove = On

	; Flickerless window moving
	BGFlickerlessMove = On

	; If HideTitle = on and BGNoFrame = on,use window without frame
	; you can resize window with Alt + Shift + LeftDrag
	BGNoFrame = On

	; wildcard => random select
	BGThemeFile = theme\*.ini

* How to build TeraTerm
  To build TeraTerm source code is shown in the following step:
  And you should use Visual Studio 2005 Standard Edition later version to build TeraTerm because TeraTerm program links MFC library (Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition can't be used).
  
  1. Checkout TeraTerm source code from SourceForge(http://sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/).
  2. Download 'Oniguruma' source code(http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/) and extract at 'teraterm\source\oniguruma' directory. Launch 'Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt' batch file from start menu. Move 'teraterm\source\oniguruma' directory on the command prompt. And input the following command lines to build 'Oniguruma' regular expression library(links to onig_s.lib).
  
       (1) copy win32\Makefile Makefile
       (2) copy win32\config.h config.h
       (3) nmake
       
  3. Open teraterm\visualc\ttermpro.sln with Visual Studio.
  4. Build TeraTerm solution.
  5. TeraTerm execution program will be generated in teraterm\visualc\bin directory if the building is successful.


* How to build TeraTerm Menu
  To build TeraTerm Menu source code is shown in the following step:
  And you need Visual Studio 2005(VC++8.0) to build.
  
  1. Checkout TeraTerm source code from SourceForge(http://sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/).
  2. Open teraterm\source\ttmenu\ttpmenu.sln with Visual Studio.
  3. Build TeraTerm Menu solution.
  4. TeraTerm Menu execution program will be generated in teraterm\source\ttmenu directory if the building is successful.
