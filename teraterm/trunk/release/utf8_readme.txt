* Installation

  1. Original version of TeraTerm Pro has to be installed before applying this package.  
     It can be downloaded from http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/ttermp23.zip
  2. Backup all files from TeraTerm directory. 
  3. Extract content of UTF-8 support package archive into the TeraTerm directory. 
     Overwrite existing files if prompted. 
  4. Make sure that "cygterm.exe" and "cygterm.cfg" files are extracted into the TeraTerm 
     directory.
  
  [NOTE]
    UTF-8 function also supports the Japanese mode however to be able to use it you have 
    to install the original TeraTerm Pro with the Japanese language mode selected.

* Unicode configuration
  To use UTF-8, select "Terminal" from the TeraTerm Pro "Setup" menu.
  Inside the dialog-box, select "UTF-8" from "Kanji(receive)" or "Kanji(transmit)".
  There is no need to restart TeraTerm Pro to activate these configuration changes.
  When "UTF8" is specified with '/KT' or '/KR' option in the command line,
  UTF-8 encoding/decoding can be used during transmitting and receiving of data.
  
  To enable character sets other than Japanese, you have to set properly the locale and 
  codepage parameters in the 'teraterm.ini' file. See example of these values below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Locale for Unicode
Locale = japanese

; CodePage for Unicode
CodePage = 932
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Check the following web-sites to learn more about setting of locale and codepage in TeraTerm:

    http://www.microsoft.com/japan/msdn/library/default.asp?url=/japan/msdn/library/ja/vclib/html/_crt_language_strings.asp
    
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/unicode_81rn.asp


  [NOTE] for Mac OS X users
    For Mac OS X(HFS+) use "UTF-8m" encoding. Currently it only supports receiving mode.
    To use this mode specify "UTF8m" as the value of the command line parameter '/KR'.


* ANSI color change & concatenating multi-line patch
  This package includes "ANSI color & concatenating multi-line patch".
  The following description was added to clarify its functionality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;	ANSI color definition (in case FullColor=on)
;	* UseTextColor should be off, otherwise background and foreground colors of
;	  VTColor will be assigned to color-numbers 0 and 7 respectively, even if
;	  they were specified in ANSIColor.
;	* ANSIColor is a set of 4 values that are color-numbers(0--15),
;	  red-value(0--255), green-value(0--255) and blue-value(0--255).
ANSIColor=0,0,0,0, 1,255,0,0, 2,0,255,0, 3,255,255,0, 4,128,128,255, 5,255,0,255, 6,0,255,255, 7,255,255,255, 8,0,0,0, 9,255,0,0, 10,0,255,0, 11,255,255,0, 12,128,128,255, 13,255,0,255, 14,0,255,255, 15,255,255,255

;	Enable continued-line copy
EnableContinuedLineCopy=on
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  [HINT]
    When TermType is set to "xterm" the applications (i.e. vim6) supporting ANSI color
    will appear in color.
    This function is from the original TeraTerm.


* Wheel mouse
  This package supports wheel mouse button.


* Mouse cursor
  Mouse cursor can have one of the 4 shapes listed below

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Mouse cursor type (arrow/ibeam/cross/hand)
MouseCursor = hand
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    arrow = standard arrow cursor
    ibeam = ibeam cursor(default)
    cross = cross cursor
    hand  = hand cursor


* Translucent window
  With this package installed TeraTerm can have translucent window (only in Windows 2000 
  and higher versions of Windows).
  Default value is 255 (opaque).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Translucent window (0 - 255)
AlphaBlend = 230
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Cygwin connection
  This package makes it possible to connect local Cygwin by using built in Cygterm.
  Select "Cygwin connection" from "File" menu or press "Alt + G " to connect to Cygwin.
  Prior connecting to Cygwin, Cygwin installation path has to be entered into TeraTerm 
  ini file.
  The format is "drive-letter:\directory".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Cygwin install path
CygwinDirectory = c:\cygwin
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  [NOTE]
    If cygterm fails to start you might need to download its source and
    recompile it.
    Cygterm source is available from the following web-site:
      http://www.dd.iij4u.or.jp/~nsym/cygwin/cygterm/index-e.html


* Select all buffer
  Select "Select all" from "Edit" menu to select complete screen buffer and copy it
  into clipboard.
  
  [HINT]
    Dragging the mouse while SHIFT key is pressed selects rectangular block of text.
    This function is from the original TeraTerm.


* Add comment to the log file
  Select "Comment to Log..." from "File" menu to add comment to the log file.
  Maximum allowed length of comment is 255 characters.


* External Setup dialog
  Select "External setup" from "Edit" menu to configure the new TeraTerm options 
  introduced by the UTF-8 package.


* line buffer
  If you configurate 10000 lines over of TeraTerm line buffer, you need to 
  setup MaxBuffSize entry in the 'teraterm.ini' file. See example of this value below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Max scroll buffer size
MaxBuffSize=500000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Availability of SSH
  SSH(Secure SHell) version 1 & 2 are supported when using the SSH2 compatible TTSSH version.

  These are the following options of SSH.
  
     option     explanation
     /1         connection with SSH1
     /2         connection with SSH2 (does not support SSH2 at server, do SSH1 connection)
  
  Example of command line option (IPv4 & SSH2 & UTF-8)

    ttermpro.exe /KR=utf8 /4 192.168.1.3:22 /ssh /2

  [NOTE]
      UTF-8 version of TeraTerm is not compatible with original TTSSH and
      with Japanese version of TTSSH. 
      It only works with the latest version of TTSSH supporting SSH2.


* macro reference: connect

There are 3 types of connection you can establish from TeraTerm macro: 

  - Telnet connection (port 23) 
  - SSH1 or SSH2 connection (port 22) 
  - Connection via COM port 
  
  Telnet connections 
  
  connect 'myserver:23 /nossh' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver:23' 
  
  Using /nossh is strongly recommended. Without this parameter TeraTerm will start connecting with the same method (telnet or SSH) that was used during last time when teraterm.ini file was saved. In case it was SSH than your macro will try to connect via SSH and will eventually fail. 
  
  SSH connections 
  
  connect 'myserver /ssh' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1 /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2 /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1 /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file' 
  or 
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2 /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file' 
  
  The first way will start SSH connection without defining whether SSH1 or SSH2 has to be used. Parameters /1 and /2 force to use SSH1 or SSH2 method. The last 6 ways allow to skip popup dialog and pass username and password directly from macro. Please note that /auth=password or /auth=publickey is the parameter saying that authentication will be done by entering password or private-key-file thus you should not replace the word 'password' or the word 'RSA/DSA' in it with actual password. Only the words shown above with italic font has to be substituted with actual values. 
  Please remember that entering actual username and password in TeraTerm macro will cause them to be stored as an open text and it is your responsibility to keep such macro is secure location. 
  
  Connections via COM port 
  
  connect '/C=x' 
  
  Here x represents COM port number. For example to connect via COM port 1 the command will look like: connect '/C=1'
