<h1>flushrecv</h1>

<p>
Clears received characters in the buffer of MACRO.
</p>

<pre class="macro-syntax">
flushrecv
</pre>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>
Characters received from the host are transferred to MACRO. MACRO stores the characters in the buffer.<br>
Character-reading commands, such as the "<a href="wait.html">wait</a>" command, read out them from the buffer.<br>
Characters in the buffer are kept until character-reading commands process them or the buffer overflows or the flushrecv command clears the buffer.<br>
</p>

<p>
The "flushrecv" command can be used to avoid unexpected results of character-reading commands caused by old characters in the buffer.
