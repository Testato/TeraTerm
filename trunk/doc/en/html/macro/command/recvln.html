<h1>recvln</h1>

<p>
Receives characters of a line.
</p>

<pre class="macro-syntax">
recvln
</pre>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>
Retrieves a line of received characters from the host and stores it in the system variable "inputstr".<br>
This command waits until a line is received or the communication between Tera Term and the host is terminated or the timeout occurs.
</p>

<p>
If the system variable "timeout" or "mtimeout" is greater than zero, the timeout occurs when &lt;timeout&gt;.&lt;mtimeout&gt; seconds have passed. If the timeout is less than or equal to zero, the timeout never occurs.
</p>

<p>
If the line is received successfully, the system variable "result" is set to 1. Otherwise, "result" is set to zero.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre class="macro-example">
; open the log file
fileopen file 'log.txt' 0
; enter synchronous mode
setsync 1
result=1

while result=1
  ; receive one line
  recvln
  ; write it to the log file
  filewriteln file inputstr
endwhile

; enter asynchronous mode
setsync 0
</pre>
