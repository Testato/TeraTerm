<h1><a name="backwrap">Back wrap</a></h1>

<p>
If you enables the back wrap, the cursor at the beginning of a line moves back to the end of previous line when a BS character is received. To enable the back wrap, edit the BackWrap line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
BackWrap=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
BackWrap=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="beep">The motion receiving BEL character</a></h1>

<p>
Tera Term will sound the beep when the BEL character(ASCII $07) receives.
</p>

<p>
You can disable the beep sound for the BEL character by editing the Beep line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Beep=off
</pre>

<p>
Also, the terminal screen will flush instead of souding the beep in the following configuration.
</p>

<pre>
Beep=visual
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Beep=on
</pre>


<h1><a name="C1">Disabling the C1 (ASCII $80-$9F) control characters</a></h1>

<p>
If you choose the Terminal ID to be "VT2XX" or "VT3XX" in the [Setup] Terminal dialog box, characters in range of ASCII $80-$9F are interpreted as the C1 control characters.
</p>

<p>
You can disable this interpretation and make these characters visible on the screen (if you are using a font which supports these characters), by editing the Accept8BitCtrl line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Accept8BitCtrl=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Accept8BitCtrl=on
</pre>

<h1><a name="C1send">Send C1 (ASCII $80-$9F) control characters</a></h1>

<p>
When sending C1 control characters, Tera Term uses equivalent 7-bit sequences.
<p>

<p>
To send C1 control characters as single 8-bit characters, edit the Send8BitCtrl line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Send8BitCtrl=on
</pre>

<p>
Note: This setting is used only as default setting. Host can change this setting by S7C1T / S8C1T / DECSCL control sequence.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
Send8BitCtrl=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="displayall">Displaying all received characters</a></h1>

<p>
To display all received characters (including control characters) on the screen, edit the Debug line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Debug=on
</pre>

<p>
If you press Shift+Esc, Tera Term enters the debug mode, in which all received characters are displayed on the screen. 
The debug mode have four pattern, a user can switch from output as usual to disable output completely.<br>
<ul>
  <li>output as usual -&gt; usual teraterm debug mode  -&gt; hex output -&gt; disable output completely</li>
</ul>
<br>

If you select the output as usual in the debug mode, Tera Term returns to the normal mode.
</p>

<p>
In the debug mode, received characters are displayed by the following way:
</p>

<pre>
ASCII code of the character    Displaying form
$00 - $1F                      ^@ - ^_
$20 - $7E                      normal character
$7F                            &lt;DEL&gt;
$80 - $FF                      MSB of the ASCII code is turned to be 0 and displayed by
                               the same way as one for $00-$7F characters,
                               except that text is displayed in the reversed color.
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Debug=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="statusline">Disabling the status line</a></h1>

<p>
To disable the status line functions of VT terminal, edit the EnableStatusLine line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
EnableStatusLine=off
</pre>

<p>
Then, escape sequences for the status line functions are ignored.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
EnableStatusLine=on
</pre>


<h1><a name="tekgin">Mouse code in TEK GIN report</a></h1>

<p>
In TEK GIN mode, the cross hair cursor appears in the TEK window. When you press a key or click the left mouse button, the key code (ASCII code) is sent with the the coordinate of the cursor.
</p>

<p>
You can change the key code for the left mouse button by editing the TEKGINMouseCode line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
TEKGINMouseCode=&lt;key code&gt;
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
TEKGINMouseCode=32
(ASCII code 32 corresponds to the space character.)
</pre>


<h1><a name="vttab">Displaying tab at end of line like VT terminal</a></h1>

<p>
If you set 'on', the behavior of tab at end-of-line is the same as VT/PuTTY/xterm. The tab doesn't cause automatic linefeed.<br>
If you set 'off', the behavior of tab at end-of-line is the same as FreeBSD console(syscons). The tab causes automatic linefeed. (it is not compatible with VT)
</p>

<pre>
VTCompatTab=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
VTCompatTab=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="ScrollWindowClearScreen">Scroll down the current buffer when the screen is clear</a></h1>

<p>
&lt;ESC&gt;[J (Erase Below) escape sequence equals &lt;ESC&gt;[2J (Erase All) when the current cursor is top left (0, 0).<br>
A user can configure whether the current buffer scrolls down when the screen is clear.
</p>

<p>
If this configuration value is on, the current buffer will scroll down as well as &lt;ESC&gt;[2J escape sequenc.<br>
If this configuration value is off, the current buffer will not scroll down. Instead, some buffers from the cursor position to the end of the screen.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
ScrollWindowClearScreen=on
</pre>


<h1><a name="UnknownUnicodeCharacterAsWide">Display unsupported Unicode character as wide character</a></h1>

<p>
When the received KANJI code is UTF-8 or UTF-8m, a user can configure the behavior of the Unicode characters which Tera Term does not support as the pure Unicode.<br>
  
If this configuration value is on, the unsupported Unicode character is displayed as "??".<br>
If this configuration value is off, the unsupported Unicode character is displayed as "?".
</p>

<pre>
Default:
UnknownUnicodeCharacterAsWide=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="UnicodeDecSpMapping">Mapping of Unicode to DEC special character</a></h1>

<p>
Tera Term in Japanese mode will display a ruled line and some symbols as 2-cloumns wide. However, some host applications may assume these characters will be displayed as 1-column wide character which results in incorrect display image.<br> 
In addition, a ruler may be displayed by using +-| and some unsupproted characters may be displayed as ?? in English mode.<br> 
Tera Term can be configured to display these charcaters by similar code of DEC sepcial characters (if any exists) to minimize the incorrect display iamge.<br> 
However this feature causes a side effect that characters selected by mouse will be copied as different characters in a clipboard.<br> 
This configuration takes effect only when received Kanji code are either UTF-8 or UTF-8. 
</p>

<p>
Some mapping characters are categorized into several groups and you can specify each group to be converted or not.<br>
If a user configures this option, please specify the sum value of the converting character at UnicodeToDecSpMapping entry.
</p>

<pre>
Type A: Rule marks
Value: 1
  Box drawings (U+2500-U+257F)

<h1><a name="StrictKeyMapping">Mapping of the function key</a></h1>

<p>
A use can change the default action of the function key and the editor keypad from Tera Term 4.62. When a user can use this feature, the key sequence like as the VT termianl sends to the server without the keyboard configuration file.
</p>

<p>
If a user disables the function key action in the keyboard configuration file and sends nothing to the server, please change the StrictKeyMapping entry in teraterm.ini file in the following:
</p>

<pre>
StrictKeyMapping=on
</pre>

<pre>
The default value:
StrictKeyMapping=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="Meta8Bit">MSB set character sending with Alt key</a></h1>

<p>
To send MSB(Most Significant Bit) set character by using the Alt key, a user should modify Meta8Bit line of [Tera Term] section in a configuration file as follows
</p>

<pre>
Meta8Bit=raw
</pre>

<p>
To send MSB(Most Significant Bit) set character by using the Alt key with a conversion to transmission character code (e.g. UTF-8), a user should modify Meta8Bit line of [Tera Term] section in a configuration file as follows
</p>

<pre>
Meta8Bit=text
</pre>

<p>
