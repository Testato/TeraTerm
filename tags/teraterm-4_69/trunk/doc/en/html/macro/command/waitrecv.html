Waits string.

<pre class="macro-syntax">
waitrecv &lt;sub-string&gt; &lt;len&gt; &lt;pos&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>
Pauses until a string, which satisfies a condition, is received from the host, or until the timeout occurs.
</p>

<p>
The condition is:<br>
The length of the string is &lt;len&gt;, and the string contains the &lt;sub-string&gt; beginning at the &lt;pos&gt;th character.<br>
For example, if &lt;sub-string&gt; is "def" and &lt;len&gt; is 9 and &lt;pos&gt; is 4, the string "abcdefghi" satisfies the condition.
</p>

<p>
If such a string is received, it is saved in the system variable "inputstr".
</p>

<p>
If the system variable "timeout" or "mtimeout" is greater than zero, the timeout occurs when &lt;timeout&gt;.&lt;mtimeout&gt; seconds have passed. If the timeout is less than or equal to zero, the timeout never occurs.
</p>

<p>
These commands return one of the following values in the system variable "result":

  <td>0</td>
  <td>Timeout. No string, which satisfies the condition, has been received.</td>
