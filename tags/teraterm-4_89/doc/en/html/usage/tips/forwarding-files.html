<h1>Transfer the file via the intermediate server</h1>

<p>
When a user logins to a remote host and continuously login to another host, a file transfer will be failure by using any method(Kermit, XMODEM, ZMODEM, B-PLUS and Quick-VAN).
</p>

<p>
Tera Term developer was never meant to support the file transfer on above situation.
So, it is recommended other methods of directly connecting to the end-point server means 1, 
transferring to the intermediate server means 2, using the ftp protocol means 3.
</p>

<p>
If the transfer fails, it has many possible causes in the following:
</p>

<h2>1) The flow control between Tera Term and the intermediate server, or between the intermediate server and the remote host may not work well.</h2>

<div class="indent1">
<p>
When the connection type is the TCP/IP and dial-up PPP, the flow control will work well. Otherwise when the type is the serial port and the modem port, the flow control will not work well. Setup the flow control correctly.
</p>
</div>

<h2>2) A part of the control code will lost between Tera Term and the intermediate server, or between the intermediate server and the remote host.</h2>

<div class="indent1">
<p>
When the connection type is the TELNET, a user should connect by using the binary mode.
</p>

<p>
By using the kermit protocol, it has no problem. By using the B-Plus and ZMODEM protocol, it may have no problem when all control characters are escaped. By using the XMODEM and Quick-VAN protocol, it has no problem when all 8bit characters can pass through.
</p>

<p>
When a user connects from the intermediate server to the remote host by using the telnet command, a part of the control characters Tera Term sending will lost. These characters will be assigned to the telnet features such as the "echo", "escape", "erase", "flushoutput", "interrupt", "kill", "quit" and "areyouthere". If a user can download the file from the remote server but can not upload the file to the server, it has the above possible cause. To resolve this problem, cancel the control character feature or escape all control characters by using the B-Plus and ZMODEM protocol. However, it will not work well by using the telnet protocol.
</p>

</div>

<p>
In each case, Tera Term can not configure the communication setting between the intermediate server and the remote host.<br>
This transferring problem is difficult. Unfortunately, Tera Term developer team may not be able to resolve the problem.<br>
The problem can not be resolved through a trial and error process, please give up your problem solving.
