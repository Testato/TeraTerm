Matches a string against a glob pattern. The pattern is a string of
pattern characters (everything except 0, space, comma, \n, \r, and \t)
followed by one or more non-pattern characters. ? and * in the pattern
are metacharacters interpreted in the normal way.

Before entry, ensure that str does not contain any non-pattern characters
and that it does not contain any pattern metacharacters.

This function is optimized for matching many patterns against one string,
such as occurs when searching an ssh_known_hosts file for a host key.
