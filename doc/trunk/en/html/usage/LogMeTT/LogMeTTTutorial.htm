<h1>LogMeTT Tutorial</h1>


<h2>1. What is LogMeTT?</h2>

<p>LogMeTT is a launcher application for TeraTerm -terminal emulator- macro. The user can automatically login to the remote host, also can do any procedure on the server. Already here is `TeraTerm Menu' as auto-login application, however LogMeTT has more feature than TeraTerm Menu. There are many features like as SSH2 connection, scheduling, auto logging, and color setup per the remote host. And also, LogMeTT can have the tree repository per a macro file. LogMeTT author is <a href="http://www.neocom.ca/">Boris</a> living in USA. LogMeTT has been included in TeraTerm package.</p>


<h2>2. What can LogMeTT do?</h2>

<p>The user can administrate some automatic connection to remote hosts by using LogMeTT. Also the user can effectively administrate these configuration because the user can register these host informations as a tree repository. However, LogMeTT does not have the feature like as quick launching by keyboard shortcut.</p>


<h2>3. How to launch</h2>

<p>LogMeTT can be launched on File menu of TeraTerm. When the application is launched, LogMeTT icon will appear in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar.</p>

<h2>4. Configuration</h2>

<p>Here's the part LogMeTT configurations are introduced. The user will experience the great thing to do auto login to the remote host by using TeraTerm.</p>

<p>1. Right-click to select LogMeTT icon in the notification area -see upper 3. figuare, and then select "Configure...".</p>

<p>2. Configuration dialog appears. Click the "Settings" tab, and then on the "Settings" tab, select the "Run at log on to Windows" check box. If so, LogMeTT would automatically be launched on Windows logon.</p>

<p>3. When &quot;Start logging&quot; is checked on New Connections tab under Settings tab, auto logging will start by launching TeraTerm macro.<br>
The log format is `TeraTerm installation directory\Logs\LogMeTT<i>menu name</i>_<i>timestamp</i>.log'.</p>

<p>4. When the user selects "Add Child" under "Connection" menubar, a entry will be added. And, the user also can select "Add Child" by right-click "This computer" on screen left.</p>

<p>5. Next, "Unnamed connection #1" icon will add under "This computer", select the icon and rename by F2 key.</p>


<div class="img"><img width="654" height="530" src="setting_add.jpg" alt="add"></div>

<p>6. Select "Macro" tab, and then describe the macro script to login to the remote host. If you want to fix the user name and to make the user input the user's password on dialog box, refer to in the following macro script. Alternative, you can directly write the user's password in the macro file, take care of it.<br>*NOTICE* Refer to 5. section about the security conscious macro.
</p>

<pre class="code">
username = 'nike'
hostname = '192.168.1.3'

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

msg = 'Enter password for user '
strconcat msg username
passwordbox msg 'Get password'

msg = hostname
strconcat msg ':22 /ssh /auth=password /user='
strconcat msg username
strconcat msg ' /passwd='
strconcat msg inputstr

connect msg
</pre>

<div class="img"><img width="654" height="558" src="macro.jpg" alt="macro"></div>

<p>7. Push F9 key, verify to work your macro script. If it is all right, save the macro script to the file by pushing Apply button at upper right direction.
</p>

<p>8. The user can select the user's registered remote host configuration n the notification area.</p>

<p>9. If the user specifies some messages on "Popup" tab in the following window:</p>

<div class="img"><img width="654" height="473" src="popup.jpg" alt="popup"></div>

<p>And then, below popup message will be shown.</p>

<div class="img"><img width="193" height="117" src="popup2.jpg" alt="popup"></div>


<p>Popup dialog can be available to confirm a notice when the user connects an important host or the user switches the priviledge level to the super user level. When the user pushes OK button on the popup message, and then the macro script will be run. Or else when the user pushes Cancel button, and then the macro script will not be run.
</p>

<p>10. On "Colors" tab, the user can modify TeraTerm coloration every time a user connects. Like as Popup dialog, this tab can be available to change coloration. It prevents a user miss operation.
</p>

<div class="img"><img width="653" height="506" src="color.jpg" alt="color"></div>

<p>11. On "Schedule" tab, the user can automatically do the macro script. If so, the user can do as follows.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Power cycle</li>
  <li>Send e-mail or call when some trouble occur by combination "Settings" tab and "User Data" tab.
</li>
  <li>Periodically backup or status check</li>
</ul>

<p class="warning">
NOTICE: If the user schedules a child tree, a parent tree all scheduling work. If the user want to work a single task, a child tree should move under "This computer" top tree. And also, please be careful of the difference timestamp between remote host and local host.
</p>

<p class="notice">
RECOMMENDATION: If the user uses scheduling feature, turn on auto-logging mode.
</p>



<h2>5. Security-conscious macro script</h2>

<p>This section is the topic about TeraTerm macro.</p>

<p>The user name is directly described in the macro script introduced in section 4, this is not appropriate for security policy. And so, a new procedure for encrypting the user name and the password is described below.
</p>

<h3>1. sample macro for auto-login with encrypting the user's password.</h3>

<p>The user name is <span class="variable">scott</span>, the host name is <span class="variable">remote.host</span>, and the destination of the password file is specified on <span class="variable">C:\mydata\filename.dat</span>.
</p>

<pre class="code">
; setting
hostname = 'remote.host'
username = 'scott'
getpassword 'C:\mydata\filename.dat' 'usrpass' inputstr

; connection &amp; login
msg = hostname
strconcat msg ':22 /ssh /2 /auth=password /user='
strconcat msg usernam
strconcat msg ' /passwd='
strconcat msg inputstr
connect msg
</pre>

<p>getpassword 'filepath\filename' 'IDENTIFICATION' $stored variable</p>

<p>The user can save the encrypted password with multiple identifications in a sample file.
</p>

<p>This macro script confirms the user password for the first time. After this,  the encryped password in "C:\mydata\filename.dat" is used to auto-login.
</p>


<h3>2. Sample macro script of auto-login saving the encrypted user name and the password
</h3>

<p>The host name is <span class="variable">remote.host</span>, and the destination of the user name and the password file are specified on <span class="variable">C:\mydata\filename.dat</span>. </p>

<pre class="code">
; setting
hostname = 'remote.host'
getpassword 'C:\mydata\filename.dat' 'usrid' username
getpassword 'C:\mydata\filename.dat' 'usrpass' inputstr

; connection &amp; login
msg = hostname
strconcat msg ':22 /ssh /2 /auth=password /user='
strconcat msg username
strconcat msg ' /passwd='
strconcat msg inputstr
connect msg
</pre>

<p>getpassword 'filepath\filename' 'IDENTIFICATION' $stored variable</p>

<p>The user name also are stored as "usrid" identification in this macro script. A user must input both the user name and password for the first time, however a user would need not input these information for the second time or later. Just the same, a user can encrypt the host name, however a user is careful of adding the host name to TeraTerm history buffer for security policy. 
</p>


<h3>3. Using telnet protocol</h3>

<p>Be careful of the difference macro script by using telnet -port23- protocol. <br>
The reason is that telnet protocol authenticates the user after connection established.
</p>

<pre class="code">
; setting
hostname = 'remote.host'
getpassword 'C:\mydata\filename.dat' 'usrid' username
getpassword 'C:\mydata\filename.dat' 'usrpass' inputstr
;; login session [*]
UsernamePrompt = 'Please login:'
PasswordPrompt = 'Please Enter password:'

; connection
msg = hostname
strconcat msg ':23'
strconcat msg ' /nossh'
connect msg

; login
wait   UsernamePrompt
sendln username
wait   PasswordPrompt
sendln inputstr
</pre>

<p>[*] A user may change these prompt strings for the corresponding remote host.
</p>


<h3>Caution of the file saving encryption data</h3>

<p>A user can maintenance the remote host connection to store the password file in security. For instance, an administrator configure a long password string for the first time, the administrator can delete the file after savine the password file.
</p>

<p>As above stated, when the password is saved in the local file, it is convenient that the user only needs to authenticate for the first time to add a batch file deleting the password file on LogMeTT startup.
</p>

<p>There are not the complete security in this world, these topics help you to tighten the security.</p>


<h2>6. Latest download</h2>

<p>Basically, we will include LogMeTT latest version at the time of TeraTerm release. However, it is not necessarily the case that TeraTerm installation package includes LogMeTT latest version because LogMeTT project is different from TeraTerm project. Sure, the latest version is <a href="http://www.neocom.ca/forum/viewforum.php?f=5">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Also, the user can get LogMeTT latest version by selecting "Check for updates" on "Help" menu.
