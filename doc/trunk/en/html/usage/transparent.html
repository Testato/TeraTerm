<pre>
  TeraTerm supports window background transparency. Now TeraTerm has two types of transparency function. 
You can select either function. 
  
  (1) AlphaBlend window
  In this type TeraTerm window can be background transparency. You can setup the value of transparency. 
The range of transparency is from 0 to 255. The more transparency reduces the value, the more window
 transparency is blinding. You can configure the value in teraterm.ini file. The entry is 'AlphaBlend' of
 [teraterm] section. I show the example in the following:
  
	; Translucent window (0 - 255)
	AlphaBlend =255
     
  As a point that should be noted, this function is enabled on only Windows2000 later.
  
  (2) Eterm lookfeel window
  In this type TeraTerm window looks like Eterm background transparency. If this function is enabled,
 TeraTerm window becomes background transparency and mixes the wallpaper with your specified image file
(*.jpg). And also this function is also enabled on Windows9x or NT4.0. You can configure this function in
 [BG] section of teraterm.ini file. If you switch it on or off, you should change 'BGEnable' value.

	[BG]
	; Use Background extension (On / Off)
	BGEnable = Off

  Other settings are the following entries.

	; Use AlphaBlend API (On / Off)
	BGUseAlphaBlendAPI = On

	; Susie plugin path
	BGSPIPath = plugin

	; Fast window sizing/moving
	BGFastSizeMove = On

	; Flickerless window moving
	BGFlickerlessMove = On

	; If HideTitle = on and BGNoFrame = on,use window without frame
	; you can resize window with Alt + Shift + LeftDrag
	BGNoFrame = On

	; wildcard => random select
	BGThemeFile = theme\*.ini
