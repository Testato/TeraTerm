<h1><a name="backwrap">Back wrap</a></h1>

<p>
If you enables the back wrap, the cursor at the beginning of a line moves back to the end of previous line when a BS character is received. To enable the back wrap, edit the BackWrap line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
BackWrap=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
BackWrap=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="beep">Disabling beep for the BEL character</a></h1>

<p>
You can disable the beep sound for the BEL character (ASCII $07) by editing the Beep line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Beep=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Beep=on
</pre>


<h1><a name="C1">Disabling the C1 (ASCII $80-$9F) control characters</a></h1>

<p>
If you choose the Terminal ID to be "VT2XX" or "VT3XX" in the [Setup] Terminal dialog box, characters in range of ASCII $80-$9F are interpreted as the C1 control characters.
</p>

<p>
You can disable this interpretation and make these characters visible on the screen (if you are using a font which supports these characters), by editing the Accept8BitCtrl line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Accept8BitCtrl=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Accept8BitCtrl=on
</pre>

<h1><a name="C1send">Send C1 (ASCII $80-$9F) control characters</a></h1>

<p>
When sending C1 control characters, TeraTerm uses equivalent 7-bit sequences.
<p>

<p>
To send C1 control characters as single 8-bit characters, edit the Send8BitCtrl line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Send8BitCtrl=on
</pre>

<p>
Note: This setting is used only as default setting. Host can change this setting by S7C1T / S8C1T control sequence.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
Send8BitCtrl=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="displayall">Displaying all received characters</a></h1>

<p>
To display all received characters (including control characters) on the screen, edit the Debug line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Debug=on
</pre>

<p>
If you press Shift+Esc, Tera Term enters the debug mode, in which all received characters are displayed on the screen. If you press Shift+Esc again in the debug mode, Tera Term returns to the normal mode.
</p>

<p>
In the debug mode, received characters are displayed by the following way:
</p>

<pre>
ASCII code of the character    Displaying form
$00 - $1F                      ^@ - ^_
$20 - $7E                      normal character
$7F                            &lt;DEL&gt;
$80-$FF                        MSB of the ASCII code is turned to be 0 and displayed by
                               the same way as one for $00-$7F characters,
                               except that text is displayed in the reversed color.
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Debug=off
</pre>


<h1><a name="statusline">Disabling the status line</a></h1>

<p>
To disable the status line functions of VT terminal, edit the EnableStatusLine line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
EnableStatusLine=off
</pre>

<p>
Then, escape sequences for the status line functions are ignored.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
EnableStatusLine=on
</pre>


<h1><a name="tekgin">Mouse code in TEK GIN report</a></h1>

<p>
In TEK GIN mode, the cross hair cursor appears in the TEK window. When you press a key or click the left mouse button, the key code (ASCII code) is sent with the the coordinate of the cursor.
</p>

<p>
You can change the key code for the left mouse button by editing the TEKGINMouseCode line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
TEKGINMouseCode=&lt;key code&gt;
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
TEKGINMouseCode=32
(ASCII code 32 corresponds to the space character.)
</pre>


<h1><a name="linebuf">Line buffer</a></h1>

<p>
If you configure 10000 lines over of TeraTerm line buffer, you need to setup MaxBuffSize entry in the 'teraterm.ini' file. See example of this value below.
</p>

<pre>
MaxBuffSize=500000
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
MaxBuffSize=10000
</pre>


<h1><a name="vttab">Displaying tab at end of line like VT terminal</a></h1>

<p>
If you set 'on', the behavior of tab at end-of-line is the same as VT/PuTTY/xterm. The tab doesn't cause automatic linefeed.<br>
If you set 'off', the behavior of tab at end-of-line is the same as FreeBSD console(syscons). The tab causes automatic linefeed. (it is not compatible with VT)
</p>

<pre>
VTCompatTab=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
VTCompatTab=off
</pre>
