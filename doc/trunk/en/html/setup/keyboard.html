<h1>Keyboard setup file</h1>

<p>
The keyboard setup file assigns keys on PC keyboard for various functions such as VT terminal functions, sending user defined character strings, Tera Term commands and executing macro files.
</p>

<p>
The default keyboard setup stored in the file KEYBOARD.CNF is almost compatible with VT terminal keyboard.
You can modify key assignments by editing the file.
See <A HREF="../reference/keycode.txt">KEYCODE.TXT</A> for the format of keyboard setup file.
</p>

<p>
The file name of keyboard setup file to be loaded by Tera Term can be specified as a <A HREF="../commandline/teraterm.html">command line</A> parameter of Tera Term.
If you omit the file name extension, the default extension ".CNF" is assumed. If you omit the file name, the default file  <strong>KEYBOARD.CNF</strong> is loaded.
</p>

<p>
The distribution package contains the following keyboard setup files:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>IBMKEYB.CNF</dt>
  <dd>Sample file for the IBM-PC/AT 101-key keyboard</dd>

  <dt>PC98KEYB.CNF</dt>
  <dd>Sample file for the NEC PC 98 keyboard (Japanese Windows 95)</dd>

  <dt>NT98KEYB.CNF</dt>
  <dd>Sample file for the NEC PC 98 keyboard (Japanese Windows NT)</dd>

  <dt>FUNCTION.CNF</dt>
  <dd>A customize sample based on IBMKEYB.CNF<br>
      <ul>
        <li>F1-F10 are modified</li>
        <li>Editor keypad(*1) and Special keys(*2) are used to send a character sequence which displays a symbol on the key top of each VT200 terminal keyboard(*3).</li>
      </ul></dd>

  <dt>EDITOR.CNF</dt>
  <dd>A customize sample based on IBMKEYB.CNF<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Editor keypad(*1) are used to send a character sequence which displays a symbol on the key top of each VT200 terminal keyboard(*3).</li>
      </ul></dd>

  <dt>KEYBOARD.CNF</dt>
  <dd>Default keyboard setup file (copy of EDITOR.CNF at the moment just after the installation)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(*1) Editor keypad mentioned here are Ins, Del, Home, End, PageUp and PageDown.<br>
(*2) Special keys mentioned here are *, /, +, -, Ctrl+"+" on a Ten-Key pad.<br>
(*3) The location of these keys on VT220 is different from a generic 101(106) keyboard. With a keyboard setup file other than FUNCTION.CNF  and EDITOR.CNF, a character sequence to be sent is same as one of 101(106) keyboard. This is derived from the specification of original Tera Term Pro.<br>
On the other hand, FUNCTION.CNF and EDITOR.CNF defines a character sequence which displays a symbol of each key top "as-is". By using this, special keys will behave as each symbol of key top when an application which utilizes speical keys is run.
</p>

<p>
The installer will copy <strong>EDITOR.CNF</strong> on <strong>KEYBOARD.CNF</strong>.
If you want to use a different key map, copy an appropriate file on <strong>KEYBOARD.CNF</strong> to meet your need.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use PC98 NX key map, use <strong>IBMKEYB.CNF</strong>.
