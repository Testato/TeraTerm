<h1>CygTerm+ setup file</h1>

<p>
cygterm.cfg is a configuration file.  This includes definitions for the command lines of a terminal emulator and a shell, and several parameters.<br>
cygterm.cfg is loaded from the same directory cygterm.exe exists in.
</p>

<pre>
An example of cygterm.cfg
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| TERM = C:\program files\ttermpro\ttermpro.exe %s %d /KR=SJIS /KT=SJIS
| TERM_TYPE = vt100
| PORT_START = 20000
| PORT_RANGE = 40
| SHELL = /bin/bash
| ENV_1 = MAKE_MODE=unix
| ENV_2 = HOME=/home
|   :         : 
</pre>

TERM
----
    This is the command line to execute a terminal emulaitor.
    Specify the full path to the command if it isn't in Windows search path.
    This needs to be described `%s' and `%d' for the host and port number.

TERM_TYPE
---------
    This terminal type is adopted when the terminal emulator did not give
    a terminal type. (default: vt100)  Then this value is set to the
    environment variable TERM on a shell.

PORT_START
----------
    This is the minimum TCP port number allowed for use. (default: 20000)

PORT_RANGE
----------
    This is the maximum number of TCP ports allowed for use. (default: 40)

    cygterm.exe looks for an unused port number between PORT_START and
    PORT_START+PORT_RANGE, and therefore can be run concurrently as many
    as this number.

SHELL
-----
    This is the command line to execute a shell in Cygwin side (normally
    /bin/bash). (default: get from /etc/passwd)
    Specify the full path to the shell or keyword "AUTO".

LOGIN_SHELL
-----------

HOME_CHDIR
----------

ENV_X
-----
    This is the environment variable to be set when starting the shell.
    It should be of the form `name=value' (like putenv).  It is possible to
    give as many environment variables as needed by beginning with "ENV_".
