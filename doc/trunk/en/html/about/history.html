<h2><a name="cygterm">CygTerm+</a></h2>
<pre>
v1.06_11 2006/09/29 (by maya.negeta@gmail.com)
        * Stopped using HOME from environment variable and /etc/passwd.
          CygTerm passes HOME which is set by Cygwin. See also /etc/profile
        * Changed the priority of config files.
          command line arguments &gt; ~/.cygtermrc &gt; /etc/cygterm.conf &gt; cygterm.cfg &gt; /etc/passwd

v1.06_10 2006/09/28 (by sue@iwmt.org)
        * Use getlogin() instead of environment variable USERNAME to get user name.

v1.06_09 2006/09/25 (by sue@iwmt.org)
        * Get shell information from /etc/passwd if SHELL parameter is not specified.

v1.06_08 2006/08/30 (by maya.negeta@gmail.com)
        * Changed the priority of config files. cygterm.cfg is top priority config file.

v1.06_07 2006/08/19 (by maya.negeta@gmail.com)
        * Use `HOME' environment variable for changing home directory if the variable will be set.

v1.06_06 2006/08/18 (by sue@iwmt.org)
        * Limit a parameter length of both '-s' and '-t' option.

v1.06_05 2006/08/18 (by maya.negeta@gmail.com)
        * Create mutex object for running check by installer.

v1.06_04 2006/08/15 (by sue@iwmt.org)
        * Add 'LOGIN_SHELL' entry which the shell is invoked as the login shell in cygterm.cfg file.
          LOGIN_SHELL: yes | no

v1.06_03 2006/08/15 (by sue@iwmt.org)
        * Add 'HOME_CHDIR' entry which home directory is changed in cygterm.cfg file.
          HOME_CHDIR: yes | no

v1.06_02 2006/02/09 (by babydamons@yahoo.co.jp)
        * Generated CygTerm's ICON by "DotWork 2.50".
          "DotWork 2.50" is available at http://www5a.biglobe.ne.jp/~suuta/.
          Special Thanks to "suuta at hamal dot freemal dot ne dot jp"

        * Makefile was changed, "clean" target was changed to don't remove cygterm.ico.

v1.06_01 2006/02/08 (by babydamons@yahoo.co.jp)
        * The following configuration file reading was supported:
            + /etc/cygterm.conf
            + ~/.cygtermrc

        * Shell is invoked with user's home-directory.

        * Get account configuration from /etc/passwd by getpwnam(3),
          getting account name from USERNAME environment by getenv(3).

        * Makefile was changed, default build is with icon executable.

v1.06 2004/01/24
        * The following command line options were added:
            -t 'terminal-emulator' (specifies the terminal emulator)
            -p port-number (specifies the port# to connect)
            -dumb (specifies dumb terminal mode)
            -s 'shell' (specifies the shell)
            -v 'env-var' (specifies environment variables)

        * Fixed to fail in `make install' if BINDIR was not found.

        * cygterm.cc and README.txt were changed to English version.

v1.05 2003/01/14
        * Fixed to transmit Ctrl+SPACE (NUL).
          The NUL character was not able to be transmitted even if Ctrl+SPACE
          was typed, because it was ignored simply as an way to handle the
          newline CR+NUL.

v1.04 2002/12/08
        * Changed to display error messages for failure to execute a terminal
          emulator or a shell.

        * Makefile was changed.
          + do not overwrite cygterm.cfg when `make install'.
          + add the gcc option -fno-exceptions against the GCC-3 link error.

v1.03 2002/07/24
        * Fixed to convert terminal type into lower-case when cygterm received
          it from a terminal emulator.  Because some upper-case values such as
          `ANSI' `VT100' of the environment variable TERM might not be found
          in terminfo depending on the kind of terminal emulator.
          (Windows 2000 telnet.exe, etc)

v1.02 2002/07/22
        * Fix to be able to start a terminal emulator even if it was a console
          application.  (Windows 2000 telnet.exe, etc)
          There was a mistake in calling CreateProcess().

        * Fixed to suppress duplicate newline on a shell by canceling LF when
          a terminal emulator sent CR+LF.  (Windows 98 telnet.exe, etc)

        * Embedded the version number in cygterm.exe executable code.
          How to check: $ strings cygterm.exe | grep version

v1.01 2002/07/19
        * Fixed that cygterm did not work with zsh or tcsh. 
          Input was blocked when zsh or tcsh started, because the approach to
          open the pseudo terminal was not good.

v1.00 2000/12/17
        * The initial version was released.
