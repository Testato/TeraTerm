<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>
Dear TeraTerm user,
</p>

<p>
This topic briefly covers "UTF-8 TeraTerm Pro with TTSSH2" creation and development history. 
</p>

First of all I would like to thank many people involved in TeraTerm development starting Takashi Teranishi who created the first version of TeraTerm back in 1994. TeraTerm is pronounced `tera ta-mu' and also, the abbreviation is `TT'. TeraTerm has been developed by original author from 1994 to 1998. TeraTerm is a terminal emulator for Microsoft Windows, supports serial port and telnet connections. It also has a built in Macro scripting language. It was often used to do automatic operation of personal computer communication at that time.<br><br>

TeraTerm was released as freeware and won Japan software competition called by "Online software grand prize 97" of Madonomori in 1997. TeraTerm also supports the plugin mechanism and has many other useful plugins. One of all, TTSSH, which name stands for An SSH Extension to Teraterm, is famous for everyone. TTSSH was developed by Robert O'Callahan back in 1998. If TTSSH plugin is built in TeraTerm, SSH connection with SSH1 protocol was able to done. Unfortunately, Robert's homepage is not found now.<br><br>

TeraTerm latest version is 2.3 and supporting OS is Windows 95 and NT. Unusually in the first time of Windows series, the source code of both TeraTerm and TTSSH are opened. But TeraTerm is not open source software because a user must get the permission distributing binary files from author, that is, Takashi Teranishi.<br>
In this document, TeraTerm by Takashi Teranishi is called by Original TeraTerm or TeraTerm 2.3.

<br><br>

TeraTerm has been familiar to Japanese engineer for a long time. But there are a few problems regarding not support for Windows the latest version, SSH2 protocol, and other lack features because TeraTerm development has stopped in 1998. Fortunately, the souce code is opened on the web site and a user can freely download. Sure, TeraTerm enhanced versions of IPv6 and transparency patch are released by users.<br>
But it is a reason why these TeraTerm are distributed by the patch form because users can not contact the original author. For the reason, it is difficult that another person will succeed to TeraTerm development. 
<br><br>

At last, we could contact Takashi Teranishi in September, 2004. TeraTerm Project has launched at SourceForge.jp in November of the same year. TeraTerm has come open source software under BSD style license. The project is ongoing as TeraTerm succession version of the original author official recognition, also is called by `UTF-8 TeraTerm Pro with TTSSH2'.<br>
The community of the project are in Japan and Canada now. TeraTerm project is forever for worldwide.

With very best regards,<br>
