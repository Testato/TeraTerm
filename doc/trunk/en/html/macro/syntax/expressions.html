<pre>
Expressions consist of constants, variables, operators, and parentheses. 
Constants and variables must be of the integer type. The value of an expression is also an integer. 
The value of a relational expression (formed using relational operators) is 0, 
if it is true, or 1 if false.

The following are operators:

Category	Precedence	Operators
<hr>
unary		1, high		not
multiplicative	2		* / %
additive	3		+ - or xor
relational	4, low		= <> < > <= >=

Note: the value of expression A % B is the remainder of A / B.

Example:
	1 + 1	
	4 - 2 * 3		The value is -2.
	15 % 10			The value is 5.
	3 * (A + 2)		A is an integer variable.
	A and not B	
	A <= B			A and B are integer variables. The value is 0, 
				if the expression is true, or 1 if false.
