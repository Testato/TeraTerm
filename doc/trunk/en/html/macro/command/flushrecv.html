Clears received characters in the buffer of MACRO.
<P></P>

Characters received from the host are transferred to MACRO. MACRO stores the characters in the buffer. Character-reading commands, such as the "wait" command, read out them from the buffer. Characters in the buffer are kept until character-reading commands process them or the buffer overflows or the flushrecv command clears the buffer.
<P></P>

The "flushrecv" command can be used to avoid unexpected results of character-reading commands caused by old characters in the buffer.
Retrieves a line of received characters from the host and stores it in the system variable "inputstr".
