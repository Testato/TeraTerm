<P></P>

If MACRO is not linked to Tera Term, this command runs Tera Term with &lt;command line parameters&gt;, and links it to MACRO.
<P></P>

f MACRO has already been linked to Tera Term and Tera Term is not connected to the host, this command causes Tera Term to connect to the host specified by &lt;command line parameters&gt;.
<P></P>

See Tera Term help for the format of &lt;command line parameters&gt;.
<P></P>

If MACRO has already been linked to Tera Term and Tera Term has already been connected to the host, this command is ignored.
<P></P>

As a result of this command, the system variable "result" is set to one of the following values depending on the link and connection status:
<P></P>

<pre>
Value	Status
<hr>
0	Link to Tera Term has not been made.
1	Connection to the host has not been made, but link to Tera Term has been made.
2	Both connection and link have been made.
</pre>

To test the current link and connect status before executing the "connect" command, use the "testlink" command.
<P></P>

Communication commands except "connect" and "testlink" can not be executed before the link is established.
