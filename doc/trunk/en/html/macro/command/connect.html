 <B>connect &lt;command line parameters&gt;</B>
</UL>
<P></P>

If MACRO is not linked to Tera Term, this command runs Tera Term with &lt;command line parameters&gt;, and links it to MACRO.
<P></P>

f MACRO has already been linked to Tera Term and Tera Term is not connected to the host, this command causes Tera Term to connect to the host specified by &lt;command line parameters&gt;.
<P></P>

See Tera Term help for the format of &lt;command line parameters&gt;.
<P></P>

If MACRO has already been linked to Tera Term and Tera Term has already been connected to the host, this command is ignored.
<P></P>

As a result of this command, the system variable "result" is set to one of the following values depending on the link and connection status:
<P></P>

<pre>
Value	Status
<hr>
0	Link to Tera Term has not been made.
1	Connection to the host has not been made, but link to Tera Term has been made.
2	Both connection and link have been made.
</pre>

To test the current link and connect status before executing the "connect" command, use the "testlink" command.
<P></P>

Communication commands except "connect" and "testlink" can not be executed before the link is established.
<P></P>

There are 3 types of connection you can establish from TeraTerm macro: 

  - Telnet connection (port 23) 
  - SSH1 or SSH2 connection (port 22) 
  - Connection via COM port 
  
  Telnet connections 
  
  connect 'myserver:23 /nossh'
  or
  connect 'myserver:23 /telnet'
  or
  connect 'myserver:23'
  
  Using /nossh is strongly recommended. Without this parameter TeraTerm will start connecting with the same method (telnet or SSH) that was used during last time when teraterm.ini file was saved. In case it was SSH than your macro will try to connect via SSH and will eventually fail.
  
  
  SSH connections
  
  connect 'myserver /ssh'
  
  This way will start SSH connection without defining whether SSH1 or SSH2 has to be used.
  
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2'
  
  Parameters /1 and /2 force to use SSH1 or SSH2 method.
  
  connect 'myserver /ssh /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1 /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2 /auth=password /user=username /passwd=password'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1 /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2 /auth=publickey /user=username /passwd=password /keyfile=private-key-file'
  
  Above 6 ways allow to skip popup dialog and pass username and password directly from macro. Please note that /auth=password or /auth=publickey is the parameter saying that authentication will be done by entering password or private-key-file thus you should not replace the word 'password' or the word 'publickey' in it with actual password.
  Important note: The password can contain space character. To represent space inside the password replace it with @ character. If @ character itself is part of the password than it has to be replaced with 2 consecutive @ characters @@.
  Please remember that entering actual username and password in TeraTerm macro will cause them to be stored as an open text and it is your responsibility to keep such macro is secure location. 
  
  connect 'myserver /ssh /auth=password /user=username /ask4passwd'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1 /auth=password /user=username /ask4passwd'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2 /auth=password /user=username /ask4passwd'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /auth=publickey /user=username /ask4passwd /keyfile=private-key-file'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /1 /auth=publickey /user=username /ask4passwd /keyfile=private-key-file'
  or
  connect 'myserver /ssh /2 /auth=publickey /user=username /ask4passwd /keyfile=private-key-file'
  
  Above 6 ways pass username and authentication method directly from macro, and the popup asks for password.
  
  
  Connections via COM port 
  
  connect '/C=x' 
  
  Here x represents COM port number. For example to connect via COM port 1 the command will look like: connect '/C=1'

* In these examples parameters shown with Italic font have to be replaced with their actual values.

** The password can contain space character. To represent space inside the password replace it 
   with @ character. If @ character itself is part of the password than it has to be replaced 
   with 2 consecutive @ characters @@.
