Format:
<UL>
 <B>logopen &lt;filename&gt; &lt;binary flag&gt; &lt;append flag&gt;</B>
</UL>
<P></P>

Causes Tera Term to start logging. Received characters are written to the file &lt;filename&gt;.
<P></P>

If &lt;binary flag&gt; is zero, received new-line characters are converted (CR -&gt; CR/CRLF) and escape sequences are stripped out. If &lt;binary flag&gt; is non-zero, received characters are written without any modifications.
<P></P>

If &lt;append flag&gt; is non-zero and the file &lt;filename&gt; already exists, received characters are appended to it. If &lt;append flag&gt; is zero and the file &lt;filename&gt; already exists, the file is overwritten.
<P></P>
