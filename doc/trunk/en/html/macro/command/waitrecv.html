Format:

 <B>waitrecv&lt;sub-string&gt; &lt;len&gt; &lt;pos&gt;</B>
</UL>
<P></P>

Pauses until a string, which satisfies a condition, is received from the host, or until the timeout occurs.
<P></P>

The condition is:
	The length of the string is &lt;len&gt;, and the string contains
	the &lt;sub-string&gt; beginning at the &lt;pos&gt;th character.
<P></P>

For example, if &lt;sub-string&gt; is "def" and &lt;len&gt; is 9 and &lt;pos&gt; is 4, the string "abcdefghi" satisfies the condition.
<P></P>

If such a string is received, it is saved in the system variable "inputstr".
<P></P>
If the system variable "timeout" is greater than zero, the timeout occurs when &lt;timeout&gt; seconds have passed. If the "timeout" is less than or equal to zero, the timeout never occurs.
<P></P>
The "waitrecv" command returns one of the following values in the system variable "result":

<pre>
Value	Meaning
<hr>
-1	A string, which contains the <sub-string> beginning at the <pos>th character, 
	has been received, and saved in the "inputstr", but its length is less than <len> because of the timeout.
0	Timeout. No string, which satisfies the condition, has been received.
1	A string, which satisfies the condition, has been received, and saved in the "inputstr".
