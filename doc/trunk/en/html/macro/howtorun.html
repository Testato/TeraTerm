<pre>
The executable file TTPMACRO.EXE should be placed in the directory in which TTERMPRO.EXE exists.

There are two ways to run a macro file.

1) From Tera Term.

To start MACRO, select the [Control] Macro command and then the macro file in the Open Macro dialog box.

2) From MACRO.

The macro file can be specified as a parameter of the command line (shortcut link) of TTPMACRO.EXE. 
For example, if you want to run the macro file "DIALUP.TTL", specify the command line 
(shortcut link) like:

   TTPMACRO DIALUP.TTL

You can omit the file name extension ".TTL". If you omit the file name, the Open Macro 
dialog box appears. It's convenient to install icons (shortcuts) for the macro files 
you use frequently.

If you choose method 2), you can run Tera Term, after starting the MACRO, by using 
the "connect" command in the macro file.

While the macro is running, you can pause it, restart it, and stop it by pressing 
the appropriate buttons in the MACRO dialog box.
