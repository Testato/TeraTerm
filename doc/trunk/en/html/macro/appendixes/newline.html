<p>
New-line characters (CR or CR+LF) received from the host are converted to CR+LF pairs by Tera Term, and then Tera Term sends them to MACRO.<br><br>

You should use the pair (CR+LF) as a new-line character to send to Tera Term.<br><br>

ASCII code 13 (decimal) is for CR, and 10 is for LF.
</p>

<pre>
Example:
	send 'abc'#13#10		Same as the statement "sendln 'abc'".
					The actual new-line character to be sent to the host is determined by Tera Term.
	Wait #10'abc' 'def'#13		Waits for a line beginning with "abc" or a line ending with "def".
	Logwrite 'abc'#13#10		Writes line "abc" to the log file.
